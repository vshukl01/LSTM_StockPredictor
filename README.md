# LSTM_StockPredictor
This repository contains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting stock prices using historical data. The model leverages deep learning techniques to analyze stock trends and generate forecasts based on past price movements.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares stock market data for analysis.

LSTM Model Implementation: Uses TensorFlow/Keras to build and train an LSTM-based neural network.

Stock Price Prediction: Generates future stock price trends based on historical data.

Data Visualization: Provides insightful charts to analyze predictions and performance.

Scalability: Can be applied to multiple stock datasets with minimal modifications.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Yahoo Finance API (or other data sources)
